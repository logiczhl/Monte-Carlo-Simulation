# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
 The future load rate of an medical waste disposal facility with Monte-Carlo-Simulation

 We used the Monte-Carlo simulation to predict the probability distribution of future load rates of medical waste disposal facilities in large cities.

# Function Description

`col_ration`: Calculating Early Warning in Monte Carlo Simulation Results

`all_city_pic`: Calculate the results of Monte Carlo simulations for each city and plot the images
